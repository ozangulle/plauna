Samsung TVs can’t get enough of Plex

One other super exciting development in our world this month is that we will be shipping our brand new official smart TV app on all 2016 Samsung smart TVs! Plex is one of the top apps on Samsung TVs, which are great for getting that movie theater experience with movie trailers and extras, one of the perks you get with a Plex Pass ( https://plex.tv/subscription/about?utm_source=Plex&utm_medium=email&utm_content=samsung_pp_inline&utm_campaign=May+Newsletter+2016 ). Roll-out has begun with their higher end models, but Plex will be included on all 2016 models that support Tizen apps.

Roku keeps getting better

Earlier this year, we completely revamped our Roku app, and now it’s even better. We’ve added Rotten Tomatoes, theme music for your collection of TV shows, and handy shortcuts to mark entire seasons or series as watched or unwatched within the app. We also added options to play a movie trailer or browse movie details from the playlist screen, as well as navigate to the show, season, or episode details available for TV shows.

Treats for our iOS users

iOS got some groovy new fixings as well. With the new post-play screen, binge watching shows is as easy as getting sucked into the blackhole that is baby goat memes. Now you can begin watching the next episode or figure out what to watch after you finish a movie. Or use offline syncing, one of the most awesome Plex Pass ( https://plex.tv/subscription/about?utm_source=Plex&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ios_pp_inline&utm_campaign=May+Newsletter+2016 ) features, to have pre-converted files accessible always. In addition, you can enjoy direct playback of Apple Lossless tracks. All that and all the Rotten Tomatoes reviews one could ask for.

Android gets subtitles and more

Android—both mobile and TV—got several improvements in appearance and lots of bug fixes. On mobile, we added support for embedded PGS/VobSub subtitles for Direct Played MKVs, meaning you can always read along, even when you’re watching in bed with the volume way down. We also updated the look of the friends screen and improved Camera Upload for our Plex Pass ( https://plex.tv/subscription/about?utm_source=Plex&utm_medium=email&utm_content=android_pp_inline&utm_campaign=May+Newsletter+2016 ) users. For  Android TV, you can now get some additional video info during playback, including how much of your video has loaded.

The best streaming music service is just setting up your own @plex ( https://twitter.com/plex?utm_source=Plex&utm_medium=email&utm_content=love_plex_plex_1&utm_campaign=May+Newsletter+2016 ) server. It's obviously not for everyone, but it's worked well for me.
